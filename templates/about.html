        <h1>About HemoVeda</h1>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            HemoVeda is dedicated to improving early detection of anemia using cutting-edge AI technology. We aim to empower healthcare providers and individuals by offering an easy-to-use web app that combines clinical data with eye and palm image analysis for accurate and timely anemia diagnosis.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Anemia affects over 50% of women in India, often going undiagnosed until it leads to severe health issues like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chronic fatigue</li>
            <li>Poor maternal outcomes</li>
            <li>Reduced immunity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Lack of timely diagnosis and awareness exacerbates these problems, making early detection critical.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>
            HemoVeda’s AI-powered web application analyzes images of the eye (conjunctiva) and palm, alongside blood report data, to accurately predict anemia status. By leveraging Deep Learning algorithms, our tool provides an accessible and affordable solution for anemia detection, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
